# Self-Service IT Portal

## Overview

This project aims to build a **Self-Service IT Portal** that allows end users to resolve common IT issues and fulfill requests without direct IT intervention. The goal is to automate repetitive tasks, reduce ticket volume, and improve the overall IT experience across the organization.

The portal will eventually support:

- Authentication and role-based access control  
- A dynamic service catalog (e.g., password resets, access requests)  
- Automation via scripting and APIs  
- Integration with ticketing systems  
- Basic analytics and dashboards

## Goals & What I Hope to Learn

This project will help me strengthen my skills in:

- Cloud infrastructure (primarily Azure)
- Automation using PowerShell, Terraform, and REST APIs
- Frontend and backend integration for internal tools
- CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) best practices
- Building maintainable and scalable internal IT solutions

## Status

**This project is in the planning phase.**  
I'm currently wrapping up another project and will begin work on this soon. In the meantime, Iâ€™m sharing the repo to track ideas, gather feedback, and outline a roadmap.
